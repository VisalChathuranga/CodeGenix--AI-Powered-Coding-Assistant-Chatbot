Lesson 5 Python Loop Statement

In the program, some steps of the algorithm will be executed repeatedly
under certain condition, which is loop statement. In this lesson, Python

statement will be explained combining with the related routines.

1. Loop Statement Introduction

Loop statement includes “while” and “for”, which is used to repeat some

steps.

1.1 while loop

while 24 Wis TAFT itFEu F: The format and execution process

of while loop are as follow.

while loop condition:

code block do while loop

Statements inside loop

condition

Outside do-while loop

When the loop condition is “True”, the block of code in while loop will be

executed till the loop condition is “False”. When the loop condition is always

“True”, it will fall into “dead loop’.

1.2 for loop

The syntax and execution process of for loop are as follow.

for loop variable in target:
code block

If condition
Does Not Is true
Exists

If Condition
Is false

”Target” can be string, list, tuple, dictionary and other sequence type,
while “loop variable” is used to store the elements read from the variable of

the sequence type

After entering for loop, traverse the elements within target and execute

the block of code within for loop till the traversal ends.

2. Loop Control Statement Introduction

Loop control statement can be used to interrupt the loop, or skip the
current loop to execute the next loop. Loop control statement contains “break”,

“continue” and “pass”.
2.1 break Statement

break statement is used to get out of the whole loop. The syntax and

execution process are as follow.

while loop condition:
code blockl
if condition:
break
code block2

True

code block1
<naton > False

True
Exit the loop

if condition:
break
code block2

False

Code block2

True
Exit the loop

When the judgement condition is executed and is “True”, the loop will end.
If the judgement condition is “False”, the block of code 2 will be executed and

the loop will continue.

2.2 continue statement

continue statement is used to get out of this round of loop and carry out

the next round of loop. The syntax and execution process are as follow.

Code block1

Exit this loop, and directly start the next
loop without executing the code

Whether all the elements
in the array are traversed?

False

start the next loop without
executing the code block

When the judgement statement is executed and is “True”, this round of
loop is complete and next round of loop starts. If the judgement condition is

“False”, the block of code 2 is executed and the second round of loop is done.
2.3 pass statement

pass statement is null statement and nothing will be executed. It is used to

keep the integrity of the program structure.

3. Operation Steps

This routine will calculate the factorial of the integer and print the elements

of the string.

Before operation, we need to copy the routine “loop_statement.py”
stored in “3. Python->Python Basic and Advanced Lesson-> Lesson 5

Python Loop Statement-> Routine Code” to the shared folder.

For the configuration of the shared folder, please refer to the file in “2.
Linux Introduction and Usage->Linux Basic Lesson->Lesson 3 Linux

Installation and Source Replacement”.

Note: the input command should be case sensitive, and the

keywords can be complemented by “Tab” key.

o
1) Start virtual machine, and click “BE”, and then click za or press

“Ctri+Alt+T” to open command line terminal.

2) Input command “cd /mnt/hgfs/Share/” and press Enter to enter the

shared folder.

:~$ cd /mnt/hgfs/Share/

3) Input the command “python3 loop_statement.py” and press Enter to

run the routine.

: $ python3 loop_statement.py

4. Program Outcome

Input one integer and press Enter, and then the terminal will print its

factorial.

S python3 loop_statement.py

Please enter an integer: 5

n!=120
Please enter a string: §j

Input a string and press Enter, and then the terminal will print the elements

of this string.

5. Program Analysis

The used routine “loop_statement.py” is stored in “3. Python->Python
Basic and Advanced Lesson-> Lesson 5 Python Loop Statement->

Routine Code”.

5.1 Calculate Factorial of the Value

1) Input data

Call input() function to receive the input data. The hints are inside the

parenthesis.

[1 n=int(input("if 4% A— 7X: "))

2) Create variable

Create two variables for later calculation. “fact” is used to store the current

factorial.
2 fact=1
om i=1

3) while loop

Use while loop statement to calculate the factorial of the designated
integer. During loop, “i” value will Keep adding up. When this value is greater
than the input integer, the loop will end. Then, call print() function to print the

result on the terminal.

fact = fact*i
i=it+1
print("n!={}".format(fact))

ac i<=n:

The syntax of print() function is as follow.

print(*objects, sep=’ ’, end='\n’, file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

The first parameter “objects” is the output object. When output several

objects for one time, objects should be separated by “,”.

The second parameter “sep” is used to insert the string between the

objects. The default value is a space.

The third parameter “end” is used to add string at the end of the output.

The default value is a line break.

The fourth parameter “file” is the object with a write function, the default

value is “sys.stdout”, that is screen.

The fifth parameter “flush” is used to control and output cache. The

default value is “False”.
5.2 Print String Elements

1) Input data

Call input() function to receive the input data. The hints are inside the

parenthesis.

9 string =input("ia ti A— 4ST

2) For loop

Use for loop to obtain the elements of the input string. Then call print()

function in the loop structure to print the input string separately.

11 print(c)
