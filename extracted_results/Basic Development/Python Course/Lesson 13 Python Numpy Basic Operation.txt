Lesson 13 Python Numpy Basic
Operation

1. Brief Introduction

NumPy (Numerical Python) is an extension library of Python, which
supports a large number of dimensional array and matrix operations, and
also provides a large number of mathematical function libraries for array

operations.

1) In some ways, Numpy arrays are greatly similar to built-in lists in

Python. It is an essential tool for Python data science.

2) Anumpy one-dimensional array can be considered as a vector, and a
two-dimensional array is a data frame (precisely corresponding to the matrix in

R).

3) The biggest difference between numpy arrays and lists in python is
that the type of the data contained in the former should be the same, but there

is no restriction on the latter.
2. Numpy Importing

Numpy is a third-party library that needs to be installed first. Open the

command line terminal and enter the command to install "pip install numpy".

ubuntu@ubuntu: ~

File Edit View Search Terminal Help
S$ pip install numpyf

Then we need to import it in python with "import numpy". We can use

"import numpy as np" to take "np" as an alias.

3. Create Array

1) np.array(): Create directly

3.1 Take Fixed Value

1) np.zeros(n, dtype=int): Create a one-dimensional array of integers of

length n and all zeros

2) np.ones((a,b), dtype=float): Create a two-dimensional floating-point

array with “a” row and “b” column, and all 1.

3) np.full((a,b),x, dtype=int/float): Create a two-dimensional array with “a”

row and “b” column, and all x.

3.2 Regular Distribution

1) np.arange(): arithmetic progression

np. arange (1,
array ((1,

2) np.random.randint(): Random integer

np. random randint (0, , }

np. random randint (0,

. 6],

3) np.random.random(10) : A one-dimensional array with a length of 10

and distributed uniformly from 0 to 1.

4) np.random.normal(0, 1, c(2,3)): A two-dimensional array normally
distributed with two rows and three columns, a mean of 0 and a standard

deviation of 1.

4. Take Subset

4.1 Index Starts from 0

1) Similar to the way list takes subset in Python, the index of numpy array

also starts from 0.
2) The index of negative can be seen as the n" last value.
4.2 Take Subset of Single Value
View with the element subscript.
xl = np. arange (

xl

Ls)

array(([0, 1, 2

4.3 Slice Takes Subset

1) For the one-dimensional array x1 of the length of 10, x1[0:5]
represents the subset from index0 to index4, and the step size is 1 by default.

2) When a of [a:b:c] is 0, a can be omitted. When both a and b are

omitted, it represents the complete set.

3) When the step size is negative, it represents take subset in reversed
order.

x1[1:7]

array ((1,

xi[:5]

array([0, 1, 2

4.4 Multiple Index of the List Take Subset

Take the subset in sequence according to the index.

xl
array(([2, 3,
x1 (LO, 2, 6]]
array([2, 6, 2

array({[11, 11,

fo, 3,

array ([[11,
[ 9,
[ 5,

4.4 Logical Boolean Takes Subset

4.5 Create Unrelated Subset Replicas
copy() can create unrelated subset replicas

x2 sub = x2L:2,

x2_sub[0, 0]
x2_sub
array({{10000) 1000,

18, 14,

array ([[ | 18,} 1000,
f 4 10, 11,

5.Array Dimension Transforming
1) Transpose matrix with T(): Transform row and column
1000,

14,
10,

2) Transform dimension with reshaple(): transform the dimension

according to your desire.

18, 1000,

6. Arrays Merging and Splitting
6.1 Array Merging

1) concatenate() : Connect two one-dimensional array or merge two

two-dimensional arrays according to row and column.

x1_1 = np. random randint (
x1_2 = np. random randint (

L np. ¢
Sut[209]: arra

np. ¢

hit [210]

2) vstack(): Merge two arrays vertically, as long as these two arrays have

the same number of columns.

3) hstack(): Merge two arrays horizontally, as long as these two arrays

6

have the same number of rows.

np. hstack([x2_1, x2_2])

array([[ 8,

6.2 Split Array

1) split(): Split one-dimensional array. Where to split will be designated by
the index of the parameter. When the function returns multiple objects, we
need to set the corresponding numbers of object names in front of the equal
sign. When the function result returns multiple objects, set the corresponding

number of object names before the equal sign

xl = np. random randint |

x1_3 = np. split(xl,

2) vsplit(): Split a two-dimensional array horizontally. And hsplit() splits a

two-dimensional array vertically.

x2 down = np. vsplit (x2, [1])

x2 right = np. hsplit(x2, [1])
