Lesson 3 Python Basic Syntax

This lesson will explain the basic syntax of Python, such as comments,

indentation rules, coding standards, etc.
1. Comment

Comments are used to explain Python code. Python support two types of

comments, including single line comment and multi line comments.
1) Single Line Comment
Comment starts with “#” and its format is as follow.

# comment
2) Multi Line Comments

Insert three single quotation marks “"” or three double quotation marks
om at the beginning and the end of the comment to comment multiple lines,
and the format is as follow.

comment

2. Indentation Rules

Python uses indentation and colon symbol (:) for showing where blocks of

code begin and end

In Python, for class definitions, function definitions, flow control
statements, exception handling statements, etc., the colon at the end of the

line and the indentation of the next line represent the beginning of the next

code block. And when indentation ends, a block of code ends.

Each red frame in the picture below represents one block of code.

Sif num>100
-  print("num>100"
Sif num>50 and num<=100:

print("50<num<=100")
Sif num<=50:
print("“num<=50")

Note: block of code at the same level should be indented consistently. We

can use “Tab” key or input 4 spaces to indent.

Note: Python uses 4 spaces as indentation by default. In general,

one “Tab” is equal to 4 spaces.

3. Coding Standard

Python adopts PEP8 as coding standard. “PEP” represents Python

Enhancement Proposal, and “8” indicates style guide of Python code.

Please strictly follow the coding standard when coding to make the code

neater, which will enhance the readability.

1) One “import” is for one module. Please don’t import multiple modules

for one time.

import os
import sys

import os,sys

2) Please don’t put semicolon “;” at the end of the line, and don’t put two

commands at the same line

print("Hello World")
print("Hello Hiwonder")

print("Hello World");print("Hello Hiwonder")

3) The length of line should not be greater than 80 characters, and you
can separate a command into several lines, and put the command inside “()”,
as the example shown below. It is not recommended to use backslash “\” to

connect the lines of contents.

“provide ample API and tools")

4) When necessary, we can input space to improve the readability of the

code.

5) In general, it is recommended to input space around both sides of

operators and commas, and between parameters of function to separate.

4. Identifier Naming Standard

Identifier is the name of variable, function, class, module and other objects.

In Python, naming identifier should be consistent with the naming rules.

1) Identifier names in Python can contain letters (A~Z, a-z), underscore

(_) and number, and the name should always start with a non-numeric

character.

2) Identifier must be different from keywords/ reserved words in Python.

For the definition of keywords/ reserved, please move to “5. keyword/

reserved word”.

3) Identifier cannot contain space, @, % , $ and other special characters.

Hite EXRS AU, KAR IUAE TL MSY hr AeA eR BUTS AR A RDU

Examples of valid and invalid identifier are listed below.

Hiwonder
mode01
user_age

4world # Number cannot be the first character
try # try is the reserve word and can not used as identifier
Smoney # special character cannot contained

4) Identifier is case sensitive. For example, “num”, “Num” and “NUM” are

three independent variables.

5) Identifier starting with underscore “_” has special meaning. Please

avoid using identifier starting with “_” if not necessary.

Class properties that cannot be

underscore

“from...import*”

Start with double

Start and end with
Special identifier __init__
double underscore

6) Chinese can be used as identifier in Python. To avoid error, please

shun Chinese.

Besides the rules mentioned above, there are corresponding rules in

identifier naming under different situation.

1) When used as module name, identifier should be short and composed

of lower case letters. And underscore “_” can be used for separation.

2) When used as package name, identifier should be short and

composed of lower case letters, but it is not recommended to use full stop “.”,

such as “com.mr” and “com.mr.book”.

3) When used as class name, identifier should start with upper case

letters, for example “Book” which defines a book class.

4) When used as class name inside module, identifier can start with “_

and upper case letters, for example “_Book”.

5) When used as function name, property name and method name in
classes, identifier should be composed of lower case letters and underscore

can be used to separate different words.

6) When used as constant name, identifier should consist of upper case

letters and different words can be separated by underscore “_”.

5. Keyword/ Reserved Word

Reserved word, also called keyword, is a word with special meaning in
5

Python. And they cannot be used as variable names, function names, class

names, module names or any other object names

In Python interactive programming environment, we can check the

reserved words according to the steps below.

>
1) Start virtual machine, and click cea and then click or press

“Ctri+Alt+T” to open command line terminal.

2) Input “python3” command and press Enter to enter Python interactive

programming environment.

:~$ python3

3) Input “import keyword” command and press Enter to import

“keyword” module.

>>> import keyword

4) Input “keyword.kwlist” commend and press Enter to view all reserved

words in Python.

>> keyword.kwlist
['False', ‘'None', ‘True’, ‘and', ‘as', ‘assert', ‘async’, ‘await', 'break', 'class', ‘continue', ‘def', ‘del',

‘elif', ‘else', ‘except', ‘finally’, ‘for', 'from', ‘global', 'if', ‘import’, ‘in', ‘is', ‘lambda’, ‘nonlocal’,
‘not', ‘or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', ‘try', ‘while’, ‘with', ‘yield']

Note: Reserved words are also case sensitive. For example, “if” is

reserved word, while “IF”, “iF” and “If” are not.

6. Data Type

There are six types of data in Python3, including Number, String, List,

Tuple, Dictionary and Set.

And Number, String and Tuple are immutable, while List, Dictionary and



=== Page 7 ===

Set are mutable.

Note: In Python, type() function can be used to check the type of

variable.

6.1 Number

Number includes three numeric types to represent numbers or value.
1) int: Integers can be binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal values.

2) float: floats are decimal values generally composed of integers and

decimals. Each floating point number occupy 8 bytes, that is 64 bits.

3) complex: complex number is a number with real and imaginary

components. Both real and imaginary components belong to floating type.

4) bool: Only has “True” and “False” values. “True” corresponds to “1”

and “False” corresponds to “0”
6.2 String

A string is a collection of multiple characters. Strings in Python are

surrounded by either single quotation marks “”, or double quotation marks

and triple quotation marks or

Strings with single quotation marks and double quotation marks are

equivalent, and return the objects of the same type.

Note: when there is quotation marks inside the strings, we need to
escape them through adding backslash “\” in front of the quotation

marks to avoid syntax error.

6.3 List

List is a sequence structure in Python, which can store any types of data,

7



=== Page 8 ===

including integer, decimal, string, list, tuple, etc. Its format is as follow.

Variable name = [element 1, element 2,..., element n]

The number of elements in List is unlimited and there can be different
types of elements in one List. For better readability of program, it is

recommended to use one type of data in one list.

Each element in the List corresponds to integer index value. The
corresponding element values can be obtained though index values so as to

change and delete them.
6.4 Tuple

Tuple is another important sequence structure in Python, which is similar

to List. And its format is as follow.

Variable name = (element 1, element 2,..., element n)

Different from List, Tuple is immutable sequence, which means that its

elements cannot be changed or deleted.
6.5 Dictionary

A dictionary is an unordered, mutable sequence that is created in the

following format.

Variable name = (key1:value1, key2:value2,..., keyn:valuen)

Dictionary is the only type of mapping in Python, which means that

elements corresponds to each other.

The elements of dictionary can be List, Tuple, Dictionary and other types
of data, but key value must be the immutable type. In addition, there should be

only one key value in the same dictionary variable.

6.6 Set

Set is used to store non-repetitive elements and its format is as follow.

variable name = {element 1, element 2,..., element n}

Set can only store immutable data type, including integer, float type, string
and tuple, but cannot store mutable data type, including List, dictionary and

set.
