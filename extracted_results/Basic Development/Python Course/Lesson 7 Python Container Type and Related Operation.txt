Lesson 7 Python Container Type and
Related Operation

1. Container Introduction

Object is the abstract of data in Python. All the data in Python program is
represented by object or the relationship between objects. A Container is an
object that contains the references to other objects, such as Tuple, List,
Dictionary, etc. These referenced objects compose the object value of the

container.

There are two common types of containers, including sequence (List,
Tuple, etc.) and map (Dictionary). In sequence, each element has subscript
and they are organized. In map, each element has its name (key), and they are

unordered. Apart from sequence and map, “Set” is also a container.

2. Container Introduction

2.1 List

1) Syntax: [123 , "456" , classObjectA , [123,"456"] ]

2) Format: list is surrounded by square bracket and its elements are
separated by comma. The type of the elements is diverse, and they can be

nested, and read and written by subscript.

3) Feature: There is no unified type of the elements in List, and they can
be added, deleted, modified and searched. We can delete (pop) the elements
based on subscript, remove elements based on value, insert elements into

some position and append the elements to the end of List.

2.2 Tuple

1) Syntax: (123, 456, 789, 100) . Syntax: (123, 456, 789, 100)

2) Format: surrounded by bracket and the elements are separated by
comma. The elements can be nested, but the type of elements must be unified.

They can be read by subscript, but cannot be written, added or deleted.

3) Feature: it is considered as immutable list and all the operations on it
are similar to List. The only difference is that Tuple can only be searched. It
cannot be added(append and insert), delete(remove and pop) and modify
(assign value to elements). In other words, Tuple is a list whose elements

should be unified and immutable, and content can only be read.

tuplei=(ic3,456, 759)

2.3 Set

1) Syntax: { 1, "23", classObjectA }

2) Format: it is surrounded by curly bracket. Its elements are separated
by comma. The type of the elements is diverse, and they can be nested, and

read and written by subscript

3) Feature: apart from automatic deduplication and not supporting sorting,

others are the same as list.

seti={i23,"123"}

2.4 Dictionary

1) Syntax: {"name" : "zhangsan", "age": 50}

2) Format: it is surrounded by curly bracket and the elements are
separated by comma. The elements should be in unified format (When the
elements are separated by semicolon, the front part should be string and the
latter part can be any types.) and Key must be string. If there is no semicolon

within some element, dictionary will be considered as Set.

3) Feature:dictionary is the most flexible container. It doesn’t support
sorting, but support nesting. Access the elements through [ ] and get and the
elements cannot use subscript. Delete the elements by pop key. (without

remove)

3. Basic Operation of Container

3.1 Basic Operation of List

Type Keyword/ function/ method Meaning
append() Append elements to the end
Add . :
insert() Insert the data into the

designated position

clear() Clear the list
pop() Pop up the data at the end
Delete by default
pop(index) Pop up the designated
index data

remove (data) Remove the designated
data
extend(list 2) Add the data of list 2 to the
Modify
end of the current list
count(data) Count the frequency of
occurrence of the data
Check
index(content) Check the position of the
content
copy() Copy a piece of list
Other sort() sort
reverse() Reverse the list

1) append: Add the elements to the end of the list
2) insert: Insert the elements into the designated position.

3) pop: Pop up the last element. And you can also specify the position of

the pop-up element

4) remove: Delete the designated elements

Listi=[1.2.;3,4,5,6-7]
listl.append(i0)
print (listi1)
listi.insert (2,3)
print (listi)
listi.pop(0)

print (listi1)

listi.remove (7)
print (listi1)

5) index: Check the position of the designated elements
6) sort: Sort the content in ascending order, or in descending order.

listi=[1,7,3,8,5,9,4]
print (listl1.index(4))
listl.sort()
print (listi1)

3.2 Basic Operation of Tuple
The operations on tuple are similar to those on list, but they are still
different.

1) Tuple doesn’t have append(), extend(), insert(), etc., therefore we

cannot add element to the tuple.

2) remove() and pop() are also not contained, hence we cannot delete

elements from the tuple.

3.3 Basic Operation of Dictionary

Method

Usage

get (key, default=None)

Return the value of designated keys. If the
value cannot be find in the dictionary,

default value will be returned.

keys() Return all the keys of a dictionary as list

values() Return all the values of the dictionary as list

update(dict2) Update the key or value of dictionary dict to
dict

items() Return tuple data, keys or value, that can

be traversed

3) get: Return the value of designated key

4) keys: Return all the keys of the dictionary

5) values: Return all the values of the dictionary

6) Update: Update the existing key-value pairs or add new key-value

pairs

7) items: Return an array of key-value tuples that can be traversed as a

list
