Lesson 8 Python Class and File
Operation

1. Object Oriented Programming

Python is object-oriented advanced language where everything is
considered as object. Object-oriented programming is to bound variable with
data type, then classify and encapsulate so as to reduce repetitive codes.
Object focuses on the encapsulation of functions and variables. However
object-oriented focuses on who takes charge of encapsulation, and

encapsulate multiple methods in an object based on the operator.

Two core definitions: classes and objects

2. Class and Object Introduction

2.1 Class

Class is used to describes the object sets with the same properties and
methods. And it defines the properties and methods shared by all the objects

of this set. Object is the instance of class.

For example, create a “cat” class, and define the name, color, age, etc., as
well as the way to eat, drink, sound, etc. And instantiated object “ginger cat”

will have these defined properties and methods.

2.2 Object

An Object is an instance of a Class, which holds the properties and methods of

class. In Python, all data types are considered as object, and objects can be

user-defined. User-defined object data type is equal to class in object-oriented.

3. Class Definition

1) Defined by class keywords, class name usually starts with capital

letter.

2) _init_ function initializes class, which is equal to constructor. Whenever
creating instance based on class, this function will be ran automatically in
Python.

3) self function, implicit parameter and the object itself, is equivalent to
this function.
4) Properties correspond to member variables.
[lelass Cat():

Gef init  (self,name,age):
self .name=name

self.age=age

def eat(self):
print ("Let's Ea

def meow(self):
print ("MEOW~'

4. Instance Creating

1) Create the class name, and input the required properties.

2) These properties and methods can be called directly.

my cat=Cat ("Tom","6")

print ("Name:"+my cat.name+” Age:"+my _ cat.age)
my cat.eat()

my cat .meow()

Name:Tom Age:6
Let's Eat!
MEOW~

5. Property of Class and Instance

1) Instance property are defined within __init__ of a class, and class
property are defined outside __init__ of aclass. An instance of a class created

outside the class can define its own properties.

2) Personal variable: if don’t want the external to access some properties,
we can start the property name with double subscripts (__). Therefore, these
properties will not be accessed by original variable name, that is, they can not

be called from an instance.
6. Class Inheritance and Polymorphism

1) Inheritance: when creating a class, you can write the name of the
parent class in parentheses, so that the properties and methods of the parent
class are inherited to the child class. If the child class does not have an

initialization method, the initialization method of the parent class will be called.

2) Method rewriting: If the name, return type and parameter list of a
method defined in a child class exactly match those of a method in the parent

class, the method of child class rewrites that of parent class.

3) Polymorphism: the behaviors of multiple child classes derived from
one parent class are different, which is called polymorphism. In other words,
child class rewrite the methods of parent class to let it has methods different
from the parent class. When child class have the same method as parent class,
the priority will be given to the method of child class, that is, the child class

overrides the parent class.

-Iclass Animal ():
def init (self,name,age):
self.name=name
self.age=age
def eat(self):
print("Let's Eat!"
jclass Cat(Animal):
def eat(self):
print("Eat Fi
class Mouse (Animal):
def eat(self):
print ("Eat

{T]

IT}
Ly

a oe

my cat=Cat("Tom”","6")

print ("Name:"+my_ cat.namet+" Age:"+my_ cat.age)
my cat.eat()

my mouse=Mouse ("Jerry”","5")

print ("Name:"+my_ mouse.namet+" Age:"+my mouse.age)
my _mouse.eat ()

Name:Tom Age:6
Eat Fish!
Name:Jerry Age:5
Eat Cheese!

After execution, the instance of child class will automatically call the
construction method of parent class, and the child class will override the parent

class method with the same name.

7. File Operation

7.1 File and File Path

1) Two key properties: “file name” and “path”

2) Absolute path and relative path: “Absolute Path” always starts with
root folder. “Relative Path” corresponds to the current working directory of the
program. For example, the relative path of “test.py” file under the current
working directory is “/test.py” and its absolute path is

“python/scripts/test.py”.

3) (.) and (..) folder: Not real folders, they are the special name that can

be used in the path. When a single period (".") is used as a folder directory
name, it is an abbreviation for this directory. Two periods ("..") mean the parent

folder.
7.2 File Reading Operation

1) Open and close file: call open function to pass in file name and
identifier. Open file to return a file object, and then call close() method of File
object to close this file. “with” statement can also be used to close the file

automatically when ending.

2) File reading: call read function to read the file content to the object.
Use readline function to read one line at a time or read all lines at a time, and

save them in one list.

3) File writing: When opening a file, you can add designation parameters:
read mode ("r"), write mode ("w") [write from the beginning], append mode ("a")
[write at the end of the file], read at the same time and write the mode of file

("r+"). You can also write directly.

filename = ‘num.txt'
with open(filename,'r+') as file object:
file object.write("Hiwonder")

L

file object=open(filename,'r')
lines = file _object.readlines()
print (lines[0])

Hiwonder

After execution, the first line of data just written will be read.
