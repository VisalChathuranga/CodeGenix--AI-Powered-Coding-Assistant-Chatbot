4. Remote Connection

This section applied to the users who need to perform remote login via SSH

when the development board does not have a separate monitor connected.

1 SSH Remote Connection

1.1SSH Introduction

SSH is a network protocol (with a default port number of 22) used for
encrypted login between computers, allowing remote control via command line.
The Jetson Orin Nano system has SSH services enabled by default, so as long
as the network connection is working properly, you can log in directly using

SSH.

If you need to use SSH, it is necessary to obtain the IP address of the
development board. The development board has a built-in SSH service,

allowing direct access via IP address.

1.2 Preparations

Before getting started, some preparations are necessary. In addition to the

development board, the items below need to be prepared.
1) Amobile phone

2) A laptop (If you’re using a desktop, a USB wireless network adapter

needs to be prepared.)

3) A wireless network adapter for Jetson Orin Nano. Insert the network

adapter into any USB port on the development board.

4) Acard reader and an SD card or SSD with pre-installed official system

image.

1.3 Check IP without a Screen

You can find the corresponding IP address of the development board by
referring to the content in “2. Configuration Guide ->2. Flashing Firmware

Using SDK Manger Tool -> 4.5.1 4.5.1 Check IP through the Router”

1.4Check IP with a Screen

Follow the steps below to obtain the IP address of the development board:

1) Create a hotspot on your phone. Here uses the hotspot name

(hiwonder_5G) and the password (hiwonder).

2) Connect the PC to the created hotspot.

3 Remote Desktop Configuration and Usage

3.1 Nomachine

NoMachine allows users to access and control remote Windows, Linux PCs, or
other devices from another computer, enabling work or entertainment

operations.

NoMachine's remote desktop technology uses a new remote protocol that
extracts desktop data and only transmits certain parameters. It also encrypts
data transmission via SSH, offering faster speeds and higher security

compared to VNC or direct XDMCP.

3.2 Preparations

Before getting started, some preparations are necessary. In addition to the

development board, the items below need to be prepared.
1) Amobile phone

2) A laptop (If you’re using a desktop, a USB wireless network adapter

needs to be prepared.)

3) A wireless network adapter for Jetson Orin Nano. Insert the network

adapter into any USB port on the development board.

4) Acard reader and an SD card or SSD with pre-installed official system

image.

3.5.3 Connect Using a Data Cable

You can improve performance by enabling a remote NDIS compatible

device. The specific steps are as follows:

Note: If you need to use this method to connect the development board, you

will need to use another method to enter the system for configuration.
Open a terminal and enter the command:

sudo sed -i 's#exit 0#echo device > /sys/class/usb_role/usb2-0-role-switch/role\nexit 0#g'

/opt/nvidia/l4t-usb-device-mode/nv-l4t-usb-device-mode-start.sh

Or use our pre-configured image. You can refer to the content “2 Development
Board Configuration -> 3 Flashing the System Using an SSD” to perform the system

flashing.

1) Power on the Jetson Orin Nano, then connect a USB cable (a standard
Type-C data cable will work) to the location highlighted in the red box on the
Jetson Orin Nano as shown in the image below, with the other end connected

to your computer.

Note: This method only provides a connection between the computer and the
Jetson Orin Nano board within the local network. If the local network is not
connected to the public internet, the Jetson Orin Nano will still be unable to access
external resources.

Additionally, please connect the Jetson Orin Nano to the power supply first, and

wait for it to boot up before connecting the USB cable.

Note: If you need to use this method to connect the development board, you

will need to use another method to enter the system for configuration.
Open a terminal and enter the command:

sudo sed -i 's#exit 0#echo device > /sys/class/usb_role/usb2-0-role-switch/role\nexit 0#g'

/opt/nvidia/l4t-usb-device-mode/nv-l4t-usb-device-mode-start.sh
