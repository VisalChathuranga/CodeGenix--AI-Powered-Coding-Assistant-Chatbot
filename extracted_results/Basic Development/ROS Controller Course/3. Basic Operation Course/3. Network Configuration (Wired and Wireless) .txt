3. Network Configuration (Wired and
Wireless)

1. Overview

The Jetson Orin Nano needs to be connected to a network for further
operations. This section will outline three network connection methods for

Jetson Orin Nano:

Wired network connection: Use an ethernet cable to connect to the RJ45

port on the Jetson Orin Nano to achieve network connectivity.

Wireless network connection: After installing a network card onto the

Jetson Orin Nano, it can access network by connecting a WIFI.

1.1 RJ45

The RJ45 interface refers to a standardized connector, with 8 positions,
commonly used for connecting hardware internationally. There are two main
types of RJ45 interfaces: the DTE type used for Ethernet network cards,
routers, and the DCE type used for switches, among others. The RJ45
interface supports three speeds: 10M, 100M, and 1000M, and features

automatic negotiation of speed and duplex mode."

1.2 Wireless Network Card



=== Page 2 ===
The wireless network card functions similarly to a standard computer
network card. It is used to connect to a local area network (LAN). It is a device
for transmitting and receiving signals and can only connect to the internet
when it finds an available internet gateway. Wireless network cards are limited

to the range of an existing wireless local area network (WLAN).

2. Wired Connection (Recommended)

2.1 Operation Steps

Noted: when developing the Jetson Orin Nano, it is recommended to use a
wired connection to ensure a stable network environment. After flashing the

system, you can simply connect the Ethernet cable to access the network.

1) Connect the Ethernet cable to the RJ45 interface highlighted in the red

box in the figure below:

2) The connection result is as follow. When the indicator in the yellow
cable connection port flashes quickly, indicating a successful network

connection.

3.1 Network Card Installation

Note: The network card has pre-installed before the shipment. This method

requires connecting a monitor.

1) Prepare yourself the Jetson Orin Nano board, screwdriver, network

card, and antenna. Loose the screws to install as pictured:

2) Designate the red box as slot 1 and the blue box as slot 2 for

connecting the antenna.

3) The antenna has a front and back side, as shown in the image below.
The blue box indicates the back side, and the red box indicates the front side.

You need to connect the back side to the corresponding position.

When installing the antenna, it needs to be aligned with the slot properly to be

installed correctly.

3.2 Connection Operations

1) Power on the Jetson Orin Nano and connect it to a monitor. (As shown
in the image below, connect the main board using an HDMI cable and a USB

cable, with the other ends connected to the monitor.)

2) Click on the symbol group at the top -> Click the drop-down menu ->
Select "Network,' -> Choose the network -> Click "Connect' and then enter the

password. In this case, 'hiwonder_5G' network has already been connected. .

3.3 Check Connection Status

Enter the command “ifconfig” to check the network connection status. If
the IP address for wlanO is 192.168.11.211, then the network connection is

successful.

Note: The IP address for wlan0 will change according to the connected router.
The router needs to have the DHCP server function enabled, but typically the DHCP

service does not need to be manually activated.
