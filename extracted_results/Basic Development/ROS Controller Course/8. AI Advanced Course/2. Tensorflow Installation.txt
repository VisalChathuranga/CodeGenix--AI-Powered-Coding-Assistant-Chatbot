Lesson 2 Tensorflow Installation

1. Introduction to Tensorflow

The installation of TensorFlow GPU version requires the configured CUDA.
Before installing TensorFlow GPU, some necessary machine learning
packages need to installed first. Note that the pre-installed system image

already includes tensorFlow, so ther is no need to install again.

2. Operation Steps

@ The input command should be case sensitive, and “Tab” key can be

used to complement the key words.

If you use the system image we provide, you can find the corresponding
program in the folder “3 Basic Operation Course -> 2. Introduction to

System Desktop .”

It is necessary to use NoMachine to connect to Jetson Orin Nano for

installation.
2.1 Install pip

Python 3.10 is already installed on the Jetson Orin Nano, making it easy

to install pip. Double click UGMMMAEM on the remote desktop to open the

command-line terminal, and then follow the steps below to install the pip,
@ Enter the command to install pip:

sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev

@ The installed pip will be an older version, so it needs to be upgraded to the

latest version:
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

@ After running the pip3 -V successfully, if you see a prompt message similar

to the following, it indicates that the pip3 has been installed successfully.

S$ pip3 -V

pip 24.2 from /home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip (python 3.10)

2.2 Install Important Machine Learning Packages

NumPy: A Python library extension that supports a wide range of array and
matrix operations, and provides numerous mathematical functions for array

computations.
sudo apt-get install python3-numpy

SciPy: A commonly used software package for mathematics, science, and
engineering, capable of handling interpolation, integration, optimization, image
processing, solving ordinary differential equations, signal processing, and

more.
sudo apt-get install python3-scipy

Pandas: A tool based on NumPy designed for data analysis tasks. It includes
numerous libraries and standard data models, providing tools needed for
efficient handling of large datasets. Pandas offers a wide range of functions
and methods for quick and easy data processing, making Python a powerful

and efficient environment for data analysis.
sudo apt-get install python3-pandas

Matplotlib: A 2D plotting library for Python that produces publication-quality

graphics in various formats and interactive environments across platforms.

sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib
Scikit-learn: A simple and efficient tool for data mining and data analysis.

sudo apt-get install python3-sklearn

2.3 Install TensorFlow-GPU Version

1) Confirm that CUDA is installed correctly by running nvcc -V. If you see

the CUDA version number, it means CUDA is installed properly.

- $ nvec -V
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2023 NVIDIA Corporation

Built on Tue_Aug 15 22:08:11_PDT_2023
Cuda compilation tools, release 12.2, V12.2.140

If an error occurs, refer to the solution methods provided in this link:

https: //zhuanlan. zhihu. com/p/513220749

2) Install the required packages

sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install onnx-graphsurgeon

sudo pip3 install -U testresources setuptools

3) Install the Python dependencies

sudo pip3 install -U numpy future mock
sudo pip3 install -U keras_preprocessing
sudo pip3 install -U keras_applications gast

sudo pip3 install -U protobuf pybind11 cython pkgconfig packaging h5py==3.10

4) To install the TensorFlow GPU version, you need to install the version
of TensorFlow that corresponds to your current JetPack version. We also have
an offline package in our environment setup attachments, but you should

check if it matches your current JetPack version.
