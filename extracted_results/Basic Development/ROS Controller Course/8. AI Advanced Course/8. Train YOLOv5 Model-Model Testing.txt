Lesson 8 Train YOLOv5 Model - Model
Testing

Target Detection

The path mentioned in this lesson should based on your own configured

environment.

1. Target Detection Using an USB Camera

@ The input command should be case sensitive, and “Tab” key can be

used to complement the key words.

If you use the system image we provide, you can find the corresponding
program in the folder “3 Basic Operation Course -> 2. Introduction to

System Desktop .”

Additionally, if all the required environments are already installed in the image,

you can skip this step.

1) Power on Jetson Orin Nano, and connect it to NoMachine.

2) Double click MEME to open the command-line terminal.

3) Enter the command and press Enter to enter the specified directory.

cd Desktop/yolov5/

:~$ cd Desktop/yolovs/

4) Enter the command to star the target detection.

python3 detect.py --weights runs/train/exp13/weights/best.pt --source @

python3 detect.py --weights runs/train/exp13/weights/best.pt --source 0

Note:

This step requires you to have a USB camera connected to the USB port on the
motherboard. If you have completed this step and see the live camera feed, it
indicates that the model has started, and you do not need to proceed with the

following steps.

In “runs/train/exp13/weights/best.pt”, exp13 represents the path generated for

this operation. Adjust the specific path according to your actual situation."

Results saved to runs/train/exp13

After waiting for a while, if the bounding box shown in the image appears

in the live camera feed, it indicates that the setup was successful.

class_name refers to the category name of the detected object; box denotes
the starting coordinates (top-left corner) and ending coordinates (bottom-right

corner) of the bounding box.

Finally, select the command line and press “Ctrl+C” to close it

2. Target Detection Using an Image

Use the images from the previous training process for detection as an

example.

1) Enter the command and press Enter to navigate to the specified

directory.
cd Desktop/yolov5/
2) Enter the command to start detection:

python3 detect.py --weights runs/train/exp13/weights/best.pt --source

~/Desktop/my_data/JPEGImages/11. jpg

python3 detect.py --weights runs/train/exp13/weights/best.pt --source -/Desktop/my_data/JPEGImages/11. jpoll

3) The following content indicates that detection is complete. The results
are stored in the run/detect/exp4 folder. The specific path should be based on

the output from the command line terminal.

4) Use the file explorer to navigate to the corresponding path and view

the detected images, as shown in the image below:

For the following operations, you can adjust the recognition performance by

increasing the number of training epochs as taught in the previous course.
