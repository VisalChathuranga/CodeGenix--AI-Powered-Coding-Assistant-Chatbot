Lesson 1 Python Introduction and
Installation

1. Python Introduction

1.1 Object Oriented Introduction

Python is a object oriented programming language. Object Oriented is a
method of software development and a programming paradigm. Difference

between Object Oriented and Procedure Oriented is as follow.

Focus on procedure, analyze the steps to

Procedure Oriented solve problems and implement the steps

sequentially with functions.

Focus on object, decompose things that

make up the problem into several objects
Object Oriented

which enables the programmer to write extension modules in C, C++ and
Cython. In addition, Python compiler can also be integrated into the program
which requires scripting language, so it is frequently used to integrate and

package the program written in other languages.

Thanks to its syntax, dynamic typing and nature of interpreted language,
Python is the programming language adopted by most platforms to write script
and develop application. As the version keeps updating and new functions are
added, Python is gradually applied in the development of independent and

large-scale project.

Note: Python2.0 is no longer maintained by the official since 2020, so

it is recommended to use Python3.0 or above.

1.3 Python Feature

1) Easy to master: Python has small amount of keywords, simple

structure and clear syntax definition.

2) Easy to read and maintain: the definition of Python code is distinct and

it is easy to maintain the source code.

3) Fast running: base layer, multiple standard libraries and the third-party

libraries are written in C, which attributes to fast running.
4) Free and open-source

5) Abundant libraries: Python comes with large standard library which
can handle various tasks, including regular expressions, documentation
generation, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, FTP, and

other system-related operations.
