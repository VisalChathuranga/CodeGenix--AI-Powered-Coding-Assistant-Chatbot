Lesson 4 Python Conditional Statement

1. Conditional Statement Introduction

Conditional statement controls the execution of different blocks of code
through judging whether the condition holds and based on the result of

condition expression.
1.1 Conditional Expression

Conditional expression consists of operator and operand. Take “a<4” for

example. “a” and “4” are operand, and “<” is operator.

Judgment conditions can be any element with Boolean properties,
including data, variables, and expressions composed of variables and
operators. If its Boolean property is "True", the condition holds; if it is "False",

the condition doesn’t hold.

The table lists the commonly used operators by conditional expression.

Comparison
Operators
p < < Less than
>= S Greater than or equal to
<= < Less than or equal to
. = .
Membership in Exist/ belong to
Operator . .
P not in € Not exist/ not belong to

Python is able to combine the judgement condition logically through the

reserved words “not”, “and” and “or”.

1) not: it represents the “not” relationship for an individual condition. If the
Boolean property of the “condition” is “True”, the Boolean property of the “not
condition’ is “False”. lf Boolean property of the “condition” is “False”, the

Boolean property of the “not condition” is “True”

2) and: it represents “and” relationship between several conditions. Only
when the Boolean properties of the conditions connected by “and” are all

“True”, the Boolean property of the logic expression is “True”, otherwise

“False”.

3) or: it represents “or” relationship between several conditions. Only
when the Boolean properties of the conditions connected by “or” are all
“False”, the Boolean property of the logic expression is “False”, otherwise

“True”.

1.2 Selection Statement

There are three types of selection statements, including single-branch
selection structure, double-branch selection structure and multi-branch

selection structure.
1) Single-branch selection structure

The syntax and execution process of single-branch selection structure are

as follow.

if condition:
code block
code block2

false

If the condition of “if statement” is true, block of code 1 and 2 will be
executed in sequence. Otherwise, skip block of code 1 and directly execute

block of code 2.

2) Double-branch selection structure

The syntax and execution process of double-branch selection structure

are as follow.

statement or statement or

block of statements block of statements

next statement

If the condition of “if statement” is true, block of code 1 will be executed.

Otherwise, block of code 2 will be executed.
3) Multi-branch selection structure

The syntax and execution process of multi-branch selection structure are

as follow.

if condition:
code blockl
else condition2:
code block2
elif condition n:
code block n
else:
code block n+l

If the condition of “if statement” is true, block of code 1 will be executed.

If the condition of “if statement” is false, conditions of elif statements will

be judged in sequence. When the condition is true, the corresponding block of

code will be executed.

If neither conditions of “if statement” nor elif statement are false, block of

code n+1 will be executed.

2. Operation Steps

In this routine, the program will calculate BMI value based on the input

height and weight, and then perform health assessment.

Before operation, please copy the routine “conditional_statement.py”
stored in “3. Python->Python Basic and Advanced Lesson->Lesson 4

Python Conditional Statement-> Routine Code” to the shared folder.

For the configuration of shared folder, please refer to the file in “2. Linux
Introduction and Usage-> Linux Basic Lesson->Lesson 3 Linux

Installation and Source Replacement”.

Note: the input command should be case sensitive and keywords

can be complemented by “Tab” key.

“a
1) Start virtual machine, and click “ ”, and then click iz - or press

“Ctri+Alt+T” to open command line terminal.

2) Input “ed /mnt/hgfs/Share/” command and press Enter to enter the

shared folder.

<~$ cd /mnt/hgfs/Share/

3) Input “python3 conditional_statement.py” command and press

Enter to run the routine.

: areS python3 conditional_statement.py

3. Program Outcome

nput height and weight in sequence, and press Enter. Then the terminal

will print the corresponding BMI and assessment result.

height(m): 1.7
weight(kg): 60

BMI: 20. 761245674740486

4. Program Analysis

The routine can be found in “4. OpenCV Computer Vision
Lesson->Image Processing->Lesson 5 Image Processing--Morphological

Processing->Routine Code’.

1 height = float(input("height(m): "))

2 weight float (input ("weight(kg): "))

bmi = weight / (height ** 2) #calculate BMI
5 print("BMI: "+str (bmi) )

1) Data input

Call input() function to receive the input data. The hints are inside the

parenthesis.

1 height = float(input("height(m): "))
2 weight = float(input("weight(kg): "))

2) Data calculation

Process the input data based on BMI calculation formula, and then print

the result on the terminal through print() function.

* bmi = weight / (height ** 2) #calculate BMI
print("BMI: "+str(bmi))

The format of print() function is as follow.

print(*objects, sep=’ ’, end='\n’, file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

The first parameter “objects” is the output object. When several objects

are output at one time, objects should be separated by comma “,”.

The second parameter “sep” is used to insert the string between the

objects. The default value is a space.

The third parameter “end” is used to add string at the end of the output.

The default value is a line break.

The fourth parameter “file” is the object with a write function, the default

value is “sys.stdout”, that is screen.

The fifth parameter “flush” is used to control and output cache. The

default value is “False”.
3) Range Judgement

As there are two or more judgement results, multi-branch structure should

be adopted.

1) When BMI is less than 18.5, the corresponding BMI value and

“underweight” will be printed.

2) When BML is less than 24.9 and greater than or equal to 18.5, the

corresponding BMI value and “normal, please keep it” will be printed.

3) When BMI is less than 29.9 and greater than or equal to 24.9, the

corresponding BMI value and “overweight” will be printed.

4) When BMI is greater than 29.9, the corresponding BMI value and

“obese” will be printed.
