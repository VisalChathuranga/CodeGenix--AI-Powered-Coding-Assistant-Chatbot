Madiapipe Introduction and
Installation

1. Introduction to MediaPipe

MediaPipe is an open-source multimedia machine learning framework. It
can run cross-platform on mobile devices, workstations and servers, with
support for mobile GPU acceleration. MediaPipe also supports TensorFlow
and TF Lite inference engines, allowing any TensorFlow and TF Lite models to
be used within MediaPipe. Additionally, on mobile and embedded platforms,

MediaPipe supports GPU acceleration on the device itself.

2. MediaPipe Pros and Cons

2.1 MediaPipe Pros

1) MediaPipe supports various platforms and languages, including iOS,
Android, C++, Python, JAVAScript, Coral, etc.

2) Swift running. Models can run in real-time.

3) Models and codes are with high reuse rate.

2.2 MediaPipe Cons

1) For mobile devices, MediaPipe will occupy 10M or above.

2) As it greatly depends on Tensorflow, you need to alter large amount of
codes if you want to change it to other machine learning frameworks, which is
not friendly to machine learning developer.

3) It adopts static image which can improve efficiency, but make it difficult to

find out the errors.

4. Install MediaPipe

1) Power on Jetson Orin Nano, and connect it to the remote system
desktop using NoMachine.

2) Double click to open the terminal.

3) Enter the command below to install and update the APT download list.

5) Enter the command to update pip.

python3 -m pip3 install --upgrade pip3

python3 -m pip3 install --upgrade pip3

6) Then enter the command to install.

pip3 install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple mediapipe

pip3 install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple mediapipe

7) Enter the command to uninstall Numpy.

pip3 uninstall numpy

pip3 uninstall numpy

If Numpy is higher than 2.0 version, it can not be used with Mediapipe, and the
version needs to be downgraded. After entering this command, if it shows that
NumPy version is 1.x, you can type “n” in the subsequent prompt to cancel

uninstallation.

- $ pip3 uninstall numpy

Found existing installation: numpy 2.0.1

Uninstalling numpy-2.0.1:

Would remove:
