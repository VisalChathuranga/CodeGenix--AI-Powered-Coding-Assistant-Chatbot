1. Overview

Jetson Orin Nano development kit features the Jetson Orin Nano module,

available in 8GB and 4GB memory versions.
1) The CPU of Orin SoC is based on the Cortex-A78AE architecture.

2) Both Jetson Orin Nano 8GB/4GB is equipped with 6 cores, with a

maximum frequency of 1.5GHz.

3) The GPU is based on the Ampere architecture, specifically the GA10B,
featuring 1,024 CUDA cores and 32 Tensor Cores, with a maximum frequency

of 625MHz.

4) Jetson Orin Nano only has a hardware decoder but no hardware

compiler, with encoding capabilities limited to 1080p30, supported by 1-2 CPU

cores. In terms of computing resources, the Jetson Orin Nano 4GB is similar to
the Jetson Orin Nano 8GB, being half of the AGX orin 64GB version but with a
lower frequency and thus lower power consumption. Despite its very low
power consumption, the Jetson Orin Nano still delivers strong performance,
with single-precision floating-point performance of 1.28 TFLOPs. The Jetson
Orin Nano 4GB and Jetson Orin Nano 8GB models is very similar, but in

addition to differences in frequency and power.
