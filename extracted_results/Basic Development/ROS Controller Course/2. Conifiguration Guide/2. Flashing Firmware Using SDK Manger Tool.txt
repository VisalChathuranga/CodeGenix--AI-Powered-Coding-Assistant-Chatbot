2. Flashing Firmware Using SDK
Manger Tool

The SDK Manager is an official software provided by NAVIDA for flashing
SDK. It can be downloaded from the NVIDIA official website based on the
JetPack version. Please note that all operations in this document are
performed in an Ubuntu environment. You can select either an Ubuntu PC or a
virtual machine with an Ubuntu environment. Ensure that there is at lease
100GB of available disk space. It is important to note that the SDK
manger is recommended for download and use on an Ubuntu 20 system,
as the JetPack 6.0 that needs to be flashed requires an Ubuntu 20

system.

It is imperative to use the SDK Manger if you want to install a brand new

original image on Jetson Orin Nano.

Users can use the SDK Manger in a virtual machine to flash image on
Jetson Orin Nano. This lesson focuses on how to install SDK tool in a virtual

machine and use if for flashing image.

1. Hardware Preparations

1) AJetson Orin Nano board

2) A19V 2.3A power adapter

3) Ajumper cap and a Dupond line
4) AType-C data cable

5) Adisplay, a mouse and a keyboard

2.1 Virtual Machine Configuration

2.1.1 VMware Workstation Installation

In computing, a virtual machine is the virtualization/emulation of a

computer system, whose functions duplicate those of real computer.

Common virtual machine: VMware Workstation(VMware), VirtualBox,

Microsoft Virtual PC, etc. Take VMware Workstation for example. This

lesson deals with how to install, start and configure the virtual machine.

This section will install VMware Workstation, power on and configure the
virtual machine for instructions.

1) Extract the virtual machine package which is stored in

“Appendix\Virtual Machine’.

Note: You need to connect the Ethernet cable to the development board, and
connect the other end to the LAN port on the router. The PC also needs to connect
to the router via WIFI or through an Ethernet cable connected to the router’s LAN
port. Finally, ensure that the router has an internet connection. Depending on the

router used, you may need to configure it yourself.
