3. Flashing System Using an SSD
1. Getting Started

1.1 Hardware Preparations:

Prepare yourself an SSD, a Jetson Orin Nano development board, a

computer (with Windows 10 as the operating system).

1.2 Software Preparations:

It is necessary to install the SSD initialization tool (DiskGenius.exe) and
the image flashing tool (Win32Disklmager). This section will use these two

tools as an example for instructions.

Prior to the image flashing, you can delete all unnecessary partitions on the
SSD using SSD initialization tool (the installation package can be found in the

Appendix). After that, proceed with the flashing.

After the flashing is complete, multiple prompts for independent disks may

appear. Please do not click “Format”, just simply cancel the prompts.

2. Delete Partitions on the SSD

Note: if the SSD is blank, you can directly skip this part.

2) In the appendix folder, ;ocate the DiskGenius.exe tool for formatting
the NVMe system, or use the disk management toll on your computer to format
the drive. Make sure to select the correct NVMe drive and avoid selecting the

wrong drive letter to prevent formatting your computer’s drive.

4) Wait for the image flashing to complete, the reinsert the SSD back into

the development board. After powering it on for a while, it should successfully

boot up.

4. Expand System Image

After a successful flashing, insert the SSD into the Jetson Orin Nano, then

power it on. Follow the steps below to expand the system image.

1) Ifthe gparted software is not installed, enter the following command to

download it:
sudo apt install gparted

:~$ sudo apt install gparted

2) Run the command to open the software and input the password “ubuntu”:

sudo gparted

:~$ sudo gparted
[sudo] password for ubuntu:

3) Confirm the corresponding NVMe SSD is ‘/dev/nvmeO0n1’ (please see the
actual one), with the APP partition corresponding to ‘/dev/nvmeOn1p1’.

Note: it is crucial to select the correct disk number in this step.

You may see that a part of APP partition is gray. You need to expand the gray
area to white, which is normal. Colors represent: yellow indicates used space,
white indicates unused space, and gray indicates unavailable space. This is

because the restored system was compressed, so the internal space needs to

be rechecked and expanded to the full partition capacity.
