Lesson 1 Jetson.GPIO Library
Introduction and Import

1. GPIO Introduction

GPIO, a general-purpose input/output, is known as I/O port. It can allocate
input and output by software, and set level to read and set the status of

peripheral equipment.

2. GPIO Library Instruction

Jetson Orin Nano features a 40-pin GPIO interface. The GPIO voltage on the
Jetson Orin Nano is 3.3V, so voltages higher than 3.3V should not be
connected to the Nano GPIO pins without using using a level shifter. Generally,
the system already includes the Jetson.GPIO library, so there is no need for
the installation and configuration described below. You can find the source
code and related API documentation for the Jetson.GPIO library here:

https://github.com/NVIDIA/jetson-gpio.

The GPIO interface functions as shown below:
