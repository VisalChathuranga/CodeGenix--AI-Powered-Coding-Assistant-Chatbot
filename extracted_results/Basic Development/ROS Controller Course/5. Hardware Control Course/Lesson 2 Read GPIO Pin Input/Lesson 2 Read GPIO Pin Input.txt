Lesson 2 Read GPIO Pin Input

1. Introduction to GPIO Pin

GPIO, a general-purpose input/output, is a set of pins on an electronic circuit
board which can be used to receive or transmit electrical signals. It’s a
standard interface used to connect with external hardware device to realize
external communication, external hardware control or external hardware data

collection.

2. Introduction to GPIO Input

Input involves detecting the voltage levels on each pin, which are categorized
as high or low. High voltage is represented by the symbol “1” and indicates an
active voltage state; low voltage, often referring to a ground connection, is

represented by the symbol “O”.

3. Introduction to GPIO Pin

Jetson Orin Nano development board features a 40-pin interface used to
connect expansion board. Calling jetson-gpio library can control GPIO and

PWM ports, as well as perform read, write, and interrupt operations.

The pins layout is as follow:

4. Run Program

If you are using the system image we provide, you can find the corresponding
program in the folder “3 Jetson Orin Nano Basic Operation -> 2.
Introduction to System Desktop .”

This method requires that the purchased kit includes the expansion board.

1) Install the expansion board as shown in the image below:

2) After connecting the power and powering on, import the

“button_demo.py” program file from the same directory into the main

directory of the board's system. You can refer to “3. Jetson Orin Nano Basic

Operations -> 4. Remote Connection” for the import method.

3) Double click al to open the terminal. Enter the command, and
press Enter to execute the program. After execution, the program will print the

input data for pin 37. It will print 1 for voltage input and O for no voltage input.

4) To close the program, you can use the shortcut key “Ctrl+C”.

5. Project Outcome

After starting, the command line terminal will display the current status of
keys 'key1' and 'key2". '0' indicates that the key is pressed, while '1' indicates

that the key is released.

For example, if you press and hold 'key1', the number following 'key1' will
change from '1' to '0'. When you release the key, the number will change back

from '0' to '1'.
