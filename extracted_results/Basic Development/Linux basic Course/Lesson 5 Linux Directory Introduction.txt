operating system are stored. The files in the directory has direct influence on
the normal function of the system. Therefore, having a basic understanding of

these directories will facilitate your usage.
1. Open System Directory

Input “cd ..” twice and “Is” once in sequence in virtual machine. Note:

there is space between “cd” and “..” , and press Enter whenever you finishing

inputting.

System directory of Linux refers to the following folders in red frame.
Linux’s operating system is completely built upon files and file system. Any
information is stored in the form of file and defined by file name and storing

path.

Linux’s directory is in the form of dendrogram, and “/” represents the root,

which is also considered as root directory.

2. Check System Directory

We can check the system directory on Linux through command. For clear
demonstration and better understanding, check the system directory in the

form of dendrogram.

Input “sudo apt-get install tree” command and install the software

package.

After update, input command “sudo apt-get install tree” to install again.

After installation, we can use tree related commands to check the directory.
tree: Display all files in the form of dendrogram.

tree -L N: All folders are displayed in the form of dendrogram, and N" layer of
the subfolders will be displayed. (There is a space between "tree" and "=", and
between "L" and "N". N needs to be replaced by a specific number which

indicates the layer of folder.)

3) Enter the "tree -L 1" command to display the subfolders to the first layer,
as shown in the figure below. The Windows system also adopts dendrogram,
but it takes disk as root partition. The C disk and D disk are equivalent to the

first layer of subfolders.

For Linux systems, "/" is equal to integrate disk which is divided into

several partitions such as "/etc", "/dev", and "/lib".
