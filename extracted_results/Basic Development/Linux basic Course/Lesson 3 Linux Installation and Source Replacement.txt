@ Create a new virtual disk

A virtual disk is composed of one or more files on the host file system, which
will appear as a single hard disk to the quest operating system. Virtual disks
can easily be copied or moved on the same host or between hosts.

OvUse an existing virtual disk

Choose this option to reuse a previously configured disk.

(Ovuse a physical disk (for advanced users)

Choose this option to give the virtual machine direct access to a local hard
disk. Requires administrator privileges.

How large do you want this disk to be?

20.0

C=}

Recommended size for Ubuntu 64-bit: 20 GB

Maximum disk size (GB):

[allocate all disk space now.

Allocating the full capacity can enhance performance but requires all of the
physical disk space to be available right now. If you do not allocate all the space
now, the virtual disk starts small and grows as you add data to it.

C) Split virtual disk into multiple files

Splitting the disk makes it easier to move the virtual machine to another computer
but may reduce performance with very large disks.

1.4 Share Folder

In later program development, we need to transfer the files between the
hosts and virtual machine. For example, the source codes are saved in virtual
machine, while they need to be read or modified on hosts. Therefore shared

folder is required.

If you are using VMware, we can directly set on VMware to realize the

function of shared folder.
1.4.1 Create and Check Share Folder

1.5.2 Common Problem in Shared Folder
@ files cannot be shared

1) check whether hgfs shared folder is created according to step 1-7 in “1.4.1

Create and Check Share Folder”

2) Check whether local shared folder contains files. If there are files in it, create
a new shared folder according to step 2-3 in “1.4.1 Create and Check Share

Folder ”

3) Configure the virtual machine shared folder again referring to step 1-2 in

“1.4.1 Create and Check Share Folder’

(2) Cannot find shared folder after restart virtual machine

If you cannot find the shared folder after manual mounting and restarting
virtual machine, you can mount it automatically. You can configure automatic
mounting through the vi editor. Since the pre-installed vi editor is a simple
version in Ubuntu system, in order to better edit the files, we need to uninstall it

and reinstall the complete version of the vi editor.

1) Open the command line terminal and input “sudo apt-get remove

vim-common’ to uninstall the vi editor.

If you wish you can add a virtual hard disk to the new machine. You can
either create a new hard disk file or select one from the list or from
another location using the folder icon.

If you need a more complex storage set-up you can skip this step and make
the changes to the machine settings once the machine is created.

The recommended size of the hard disk is 10.00 GB.

Storage on physical hard disk

Please choose whether the new virtual hard disk file should grow as it is
used (dynamically allocated) or if it should be created at its maximum size

(fixed size).

A dynamically allocated hard disk file will only use space on your
physical hard disk as it fills up (up to a maximum fixed size), although it
will not shrink again automatically when space on it is freed.

A fixed size hard disk file may take longer to create on some systems but is
often faster to use.
