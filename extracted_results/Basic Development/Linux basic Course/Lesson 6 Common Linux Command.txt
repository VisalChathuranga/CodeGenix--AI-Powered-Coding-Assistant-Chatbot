1. Linux Command Form

Linux command is in the form of “command+toptiontoperation object”.
And for the command part, we need to input the command name, and the
option defines the execution characteristics of the command, which involves

two options, including long and short.

For example, long option uses the form of “-- + integrate word”, like
--help. And short option adopts the form of “- + individual character’, such as
“a”. Note: we can combine several short options, for example -h -I -a == -hla,
however we can't integrate the long options, like --help cannot be followed by

other word.

:~$ ls -l -a -h /boot/ff

Pay attention, command and option, option and option, option and
operation object, as well as operation object and operation object must be
separated by Space. /boot in the picture above refers to the operation object

and there can be multiple operation objects.

2. Practical Operation

1) Start the virtual machine, and press “Ctrl+Alt+T”, or right click and

select “Open Terminal” to enter the terminal interface.

2) Input the first command “pwd” which is used to print the current working

directory, and then you will get the full path, like /home/hiwonder.

:~S pwd

home /hiwonder

3) Next, input the command “Is” which is used to list files in the current
working directory, and we can input “Is -I” and “Is -a” to obtain the file

permission, modify the date, etc.

:~$ ls

2

examples.desktop

4) Press “PrtSC’” or “PRTSCR’”, you can capture the current screen. The
—

photos are stored under this path, /home/Pictures and you can click “ =

(file manager) to find this path.

5) Then back to LX interface, and input “cd” command to switch to other
folder. In step 3, all files in the current working directory are listed, therefore we

need to input “cd” command to switch to “/Pictures” folder.

Tips: in Linux system, commands, file name or file path can be
implemented by “Tab” key. For example, when you want to switch to “/Pictures”
directory, we can input “cd Pict” and press “Tab” key, and then the command
will be automatically completed as "cd Pictures/". If there are no overlapping
characters whenever you press "Tab" key, the complete file name will appear
on the terminal. If there are overlapping name characters, all file named with

these characters will show up.

:~$ cd Pictures/

6) Now, we enter the directory where the screenshot is stored, and we can

input “Is” command to check the files under this directory.

7) In later project management, we can find the required project or file in

this way.

3. Effective Way to Input Command

3.1 Help Command

1) We can input ‘command’ --help to check the usage of some

command. Take “Is” command for example.

2) Input “Is --help” in the terminal, and the content in yellow frame is

the usage of “Is” command.

:~$ ls --help
Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

Mandatory arguments to Long options are mandatory for short options too.
"8,2 °- OL Go not ignore entrres Starting with .
-A, --almost-all do not list implied . and ..
--author with -L, print the author of each file
--escape print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters
--block-size=SIZE scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g.,
'--block-size=M' prints sizes in units of
1,048,576 bytes; see SIZE format below
--ignore-backups do not list implied entries ending with ~
with -lt: sort by, and show, ctime (time of last

3) For example, input “Is -a” in the terminal to check all files in the

folder.

: .sudo_as_admin_successful
.bash_history 7
.bash_logout examples.desktop

.bashrc -_Pam_environment .xinputrc

.ICEauthority

-profile

4) Input “Is -al” to view the property of all the files.

root root Fs

hiwonder hiwonder : .bash_history
hiwonder hiwonder : .bash_Logout

hiwonder hiwonder : .bashre
hiwonder hiwonder

3.2 “man” Command

Input “man” command, we can view the reference manuals of a command.

“man” is short for manuel.

:~S man
hat manual page do you want?

1) You can use the following shortcut keys to turn pages.

Function Shortcut
Next page SPACE
Last page B
Next line ENTER
Last line K
Back to terminal | :Q

2) In addition to the above commands and buttons, there are some

special control buttons in the Linux system.

Ket Function
tT Command history
Tab Complete command

Ctrl+C | Stop the running
programming
Ctrl+D | Exit terminal
interface

Ctri+A | Switch the pointer to
the beginning of the
line

3) If you want to check the meaning of “cp” command, we can input “man
cp” command and press Enter. The content printed in “NAME” area is its

meaning.
