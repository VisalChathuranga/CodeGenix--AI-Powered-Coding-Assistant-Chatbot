1.1.4 Semantic Understanding with
Large Language Model

Before starting this section, make sure you have completed the API key

configuration outlined in the file 1.3 Large Language Model Accessing.

In this lesson, we’ll use a large language model to analyze and summarize

short passages of text.

1) Start by opening a new terminal window, then navigate to the large model

project directory:
cd large_models/
Large models/

2) Next, run the demo program with the following command:

python3 openai_lIim_nlu_demo.py

3) As shown in the output, the model demonstrates strong summarization
abilities.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on simulating human intellige
nce through applications like natural Language processing, image recognition, and autonomous drivi
ng. The advent of deep Learning, which mimics bratn neuron activity, has significantly advanced AI

by enabling pattern recognition and complex task performance using large datasets. Despite its pr

ogress, AI faces challenges related to transparency, fairness, and its impact on the job market. F
uture AI development will rely on ensuring safety and controllability while continuing to drive in
novation and societal change.

4) The result matches the prompt defined in the program — where a passage

of text is provided to the model, and it generates a concise summary.
