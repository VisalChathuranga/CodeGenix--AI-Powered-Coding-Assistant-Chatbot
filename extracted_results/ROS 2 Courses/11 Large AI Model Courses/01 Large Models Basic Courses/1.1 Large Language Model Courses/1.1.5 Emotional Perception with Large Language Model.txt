1.1.5 Emotional Perception with Large
Language Model

To proceed with this section, ensure that you have completed the API key

configuration as described in the file 1.3 Large Language Model Accessing.

In this lesson, we will use a large language model to assess its ability to
perceive emotions based on descriptive words. We'll provide the model with

emotional expressions and evaluate its response.

1) Start by opening a new terminal window, then navigate to the large model

project directory:
cd large_models/
large models/
2) Next, run the demo program with the following command:

python3 openai_llm_er_demo.py

openat_Llm_er _demo.py

3) From the output, you will see that the model successfully identifies and
understands the emotions conveyed, providing a text-based response

accordingly.

I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. If you'd like to talk about what's bothering you, I'm here to listen.

I’m glad to see you’re Laughing! Humor can really lighten the mood. What's on your mind?

4) In this program, we send two emotional expressions to the model: the first
is an expression of sadness, "So Sad." After the model responds, we then
send an expression of happiness, "Ha Ha," and observe how the model

reacts.
