1.3.3 Vision Language Model: Object
Detection
Note:

1) This section requires the configuration of the API key in "1.3.2 Vision
Language Model Accessing" before proceeding. Additionally, ensure

that the images to be used in this section are imported.

2) This experiment requires either an Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi
connection to ensure the main control device can access the network

properly.

3) In this course, we will use a program to transmit an image to the large
model for recognition, which will then identify and locate the objects

within the image by drawing bounding boxes around them.

. Experiment Steps

1) Execute the following command to navigate to the directory of Large

Model.

cd large_models/
large models/

2) Run the program:

python3 qwen_vilm_detect_demo.py

qwen _vllm detect demo.py

2. Function Realization

After running the program, the positions of the fruits in the image will be

circled.

non", 0.518, 0.088, 0.923, 0.713],

{'persimmoni': ['persimmon', 0.107, 0.143, 0.526, 0.817], ‘persimmon2': ['persimmon', 0.518, 0.088, 0.923, 0.713]}

3. Function Expansion

We can switch the image and change the large model to experience different

functionalities of various models.

4. Change Pictures

1) Click on the path box to navigate to the following directory:

/home/ubuntu/large_models/resources/pictures/

2) Then, input the command:
vim large_models/qwen_vlilm_detect_demo.py

large_models/qwen_vllm_detect_demo.py

3) Press the "i" key on your keyboard, which will display "INSERT" at the

bottom.

4) Change the image recognition path from:

./resources/pictures/test_image_understand.jpeg

To: image = cv2.imread('./resources/pictures/apples.png')
