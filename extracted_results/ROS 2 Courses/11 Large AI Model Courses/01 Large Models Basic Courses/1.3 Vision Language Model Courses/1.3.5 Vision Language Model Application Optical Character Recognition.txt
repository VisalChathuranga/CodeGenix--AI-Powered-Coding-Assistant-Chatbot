3.5 Vision Language Model: Optical
Character Recognition
Note:

1) This section requires the configuration of the API key in "1.3.2 Vision
Language Model Accessing" before proceeding. Additionally, ensure

that the images to be used in this section are imported.

2) This experiment requires either an Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi
connection to ensure the main control device can access the network

properly.

3) In this course, we use a program to transmit an image to the large
model for recognition, extracting and identifying the text within the

image.

. Experiment Steps

1) Execute the following command to navigate to the directory of Large

Model.

cd large_models/
large models/

2) Run the program:

python3 openai_vilm_ocr.py

openai_vllm_ ocr.py

2. Function Realization

After running the program, the output printed will be consistent with the content

of the image sent.

3. Function Expansion

We can switch the image and change the large model to experience different

functionalities of various models.

4. Change Pictures

1) Drag the image directly into the '~/large_models/resources/pictures/' path
using MobaXterm. Here, we can drag in the image named 'ocr1.png' as an

example, and let the program recognize the text 'COME ON".

2) Then, input the command:
vim ~/large_models/openai_vilm_ocr.py
~/large models/openai_ vllm ocr.py

3) Press the "i" key on your keyboard, which will display "INSERT" at the

bottom.

Large_models/openat_vllm_ocr.py

-- INSERT --

4) Change the image recognition path from: ./resources/pictures/ocr.jpeg
To: image = cv2.imread('./resources/pictures/ocr1.png')

image = cv2.imread('./resources/pictures/ocr1.png)

image = cv2. imread(

5) Run the program:

python3 ~/large_models/openai_vllm_ocr.py

~/large_ models/openai _vilm_ ocr.py
