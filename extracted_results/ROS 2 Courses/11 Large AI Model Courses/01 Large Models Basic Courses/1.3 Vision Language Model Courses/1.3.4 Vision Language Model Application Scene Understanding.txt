3.4 Vision Language Model: Scene
Understanding
Note:

1) This section requires the configuration of the API key in "1.3.2 Vision
Language Model Accessing" before proceeding. Additionally, ensure

that the images to be used in this section are imported.

2) This experiment requires either an Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi

connection to ensure the main control device can access the network
properly.

3) In this course, we will use a program to send an image to the large
model for recognition and generate a description of the content

within the image.

1. Experiment Steps

1) Execute the following command to navigate to the directory of Large

Model.

cd large_models/
large models/

2) Run the program:

python3 openai_vilm_understand.py

openai_vllm_ understand. py

2. Function Realization

After running the program, the output printed matches our request of "Describe

the image."

The image shows an assortment of fresh vegetables arranged in a collage. It includes:

. Zucchini with its flower.

. Tomatoes and eggplant.

- A couple of tomatoes, one whole and one sliced.

. An ear of corn partially husked.

. A group of vegetables including a red bell pepper, cabbage, and garlic.

. A few cucumbers.

The background is a transparent checkerboard pattern typical of image files with no background.

3. Function Expansion

If you need to recognize your own image, you should place the image in the

corresponding path and modify the image path in the program.

1) First, drag your image directly into the ~/large_models/resources/pictures/
path using MobaXterm, and rename the image to test.png.

G ome/ubuntu/large_models/resources/pictures/

y « Name Size (KB)

2) Then, open the scene understanding script by entering the following

command in the terminal:
vim ~/large_models/vilm_understand.py
~/large_ models/vllm understand. py

3) Change the image path in the code to reflect the name of your image (e.g.,

test.png).
