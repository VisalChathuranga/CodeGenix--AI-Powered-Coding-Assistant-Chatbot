1.2.1 Overview of Large Speech Model

1. What is a Large Speech Model?

A Speech Large Model (LSM) refers to a machine learning model that
uses deep learning techniques to process and understand speech data.
These models can be applied in a variety of tasks, such as speech
recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, and emotional
analysis of speech. The design and training of these models typically
require large amounts of speech data and substantial computational

resources, which is why they are referred to as "large models."

2. Why Do We Need Large Speech Model?

With the advancement of artificial intelligence and deep learning,
traditional speech processing methods face many limitations. Large
models leverage vast amounts of data and deep neural networks to learn
and understand the complex features within speech, thereby improving

the accuracy and naturalness of speech recognition and generation.
Their advantages include:

1) High Accuracy: They maintain a high recognition rate even in noisy

environments and with various accents.

2) Naturalness: Speech generated by synthesis models is more natural,

closely resembling human speech.

3) Versatility: These models support a wide range of languages and
tasks, such as multilingual speech recognition, speech-to-text (STT),

text-to-speech (TTS), and emotion recognition.

3. Development of Speech Recognition Technology

Word-Level Speech Recognition: At this stage, speech recognition

systems could only recognize individual words

Phrase-Level Speech Recognition: With the expansion of data and
advancements in algorithms, speech recognition systems gradually
gained the ability to recognize longer phrases, such as "Please turn on

my computer."

Sentence-Level Speech Recognition: In recent years, with the
emergence of Al large models, speech recognition systems have become
capable of recognizing entire sentences and understanding their

underlying meaning.

4. Differences Between Large Speech Model and

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies
4.1 Processing Methods

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies: These typically rely on
manual feature extraction and shallow models, such as Gaussian Mixture
Models (GMM) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM), to process speech

signals.

Large Speech Model: These use end-to-end learning, directly mapping
raw speech waveforms to target outputs (such as text or another speech
signal), reducing the reliance on manual feature extraction. They are
typically based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional

Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and

Transformers.

4.2 Model Complexity

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies: These models are

relatively simple, with fewer parameters.

Large Speech Model: These models have complex structures and a
large number of parameters, enabling them to capture more subtle

speech features and contextual information.
4.3 Recognition Capability

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies: These are highly
adaptable to specific scenarios and conditions, but their recognition

capability is limited when encountering new, unseen data.

Large Speech Model: Due to their large number of parameters and
powerful learning ability, they offer superior recognition capabilities and

can adapt to a wider variety of speech data and environments.
4.4 Training Data Requirements

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies: These typically require
less data for training, but the data must be highly annotated and of high

quality.

Large Speech Model: These require vast amounts of training data to
fully learn the complexities of speech, often necessitating large quantities
of annotated data or the use of unsupervised/self-supervised learning

methods.

5. Core Technologies of Speech Large Model
5.1 Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

ASR is the technology that converts human speech into text. The core
steps of a speech recognition system include feature extraction, acoustic

modeling, and language modeling.
5.2 Text-to-Speech (TTS)

TTS is the technology that converts text into speech. Common speech

synthesis models include the Tacotron series, FastSpeech, and VITS.
5.3 Speech Enhancement and Noise Reduction

Speech enhancement techniques are used to improve the quality of
speech signals, typically for eliminating background noise and echoes.

This is crucial for speech recognition applications in noisy environments.

6. Applications of Speech Large Model

Intelligent Voice Assistants: For instance, Amazon Alexa and Google

Home, which engage with users through voice interactions.

Customer Service Chatbots: In the customer service sector, speech large
models assist businesses in enhancing service efficiency by swiftly
processing customer inquiries through speech recognition technology,

enabling 24/7 support.

Healthcare: Helping doctors with medical record-keeping, thus improving

work efficiency.

Speech-to-Text: Speech large models excel in converting speech to text,
offering accurate recognition and transcription in a variety of contexts.
