1.2.2 Voice Device Introduction and
Testing

1. Device Overview

1.1.WonderEchoPro

1.1.1.Introduction

WonderEcho Pro, also known as the Al Voice Interaction Box, is equipped
with a high-performance noise-canceling microphone and a high-fidelity
speaker. It utilizes a USB-to-audio module, making it plug-and-play with
no drivers required, and is compatible with multiple operating systems for

both playback and recording.

Integrating various voice processing technologies, WonderEcho Pro
features advanced noise suppression algorithms that effectively filter
background noise from the environment. It supports a complete voice
interaction process—from wake-up to recognition and response. With its
modular design, each functional component (e.g., wake word detection,
sound detection, speech recognition, and synthesis) can be developed

and tested independently.
1.1.2.Features and Specifications

1. Built-in microphone and speaker interface, supporting both

audio input and output

2. Driver-free, plug-and-play functionality compatible with

Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and more

3 Standard USB 2.0 interface

1.2.6-Microphone Circular Array

1.2.1.Introduction

The 6-Microphone Circular Array is a high-sensitivity, high signal-to-noise
ratio microphone board. It features six analog silicon microphones
arranged in a circular pattern. When paired with a main control board, it
supports high-performance Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC),
environmental noise reduction, and factory-level voice pickup from up to

10 meters.

1.2.2.Features and Specifications

Operating Voltage: 3.3V (typical)

Operating Current: 0.8mA (typical)

Operating Temperature: -20°C (min), 25°C (typical), 70°C (max)

Operating Humidity: Up to 95% relative humidity (max)

2. Recording and Playback Test

The following demonstration uses the Raspberry Pi 5 as an example. The
connection and testing steps are also applicable to other compatible

devices such as the Jetson series:

2.1 Connection Illustration and Detection

If the main controller is a Raspberry Pi, you can use VNC remote desktop
access (refer to the appendix: Remote Access and File Transfer) to log
into the Raspberry Pi system. Once connected, check the upper right
corner of the desktop for microphone and speaker icons. As shown in the
image below, the presence of these icons indicates a successful

connection.

If you're using a NVIDIA Jetson device, you can connect via the
NoMachine remote access tool. After logging in, check the upper right
corner of the system interface for the speaker icon to confirm successful

detection.

2.2 Recording Test

1) Next, open a new terminal window and enter the following command
to check the available recording devices. Note that the -I option is a
lowercase "L". You should see the card number (card) listed—for
example, card 0. This is just an example; please refer to your actual

query result.

arecord -l

-1
** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****

card 0: Device [USB PnP Audio Device], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]

Subdevices: 1/1

Subdevice #0: subdevice #0

2) Then, use the following command to start recording. Replace the
red-marked card number (hw:0,0) with the actual number you found in

the previous step:

arecord -D hw:0,0 -f S16_LE -r 16000 -c 2 test.wav

3) This will create a test.wav audio file in the current directory.

-D hw:0,0 -f S16_LE -r 16000 -c 2 test.wav

4) You can record a short 5-second sample, then press Ctrl + C to stop

the recording.

2.3 Playback Test

1) After the recording is complete, you can check whether the audio file

was successfully created by listing the contents of the current

2) If test.wav appears in the list, the recording was successful. To play

back the recording, use the following command:

aplay test.wav
