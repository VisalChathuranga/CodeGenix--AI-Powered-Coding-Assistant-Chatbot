Every time before entering the container, it is inconvenient to enter command
in the terminator terminal. You can set the command to enter the container in

the terminator tool.

3) Right-click on the terminator window, and then select “Preference”.

3. Tree Tool Installation

The Tree is a command-line tool, used to list the hierarchical structure of
directories and files in a tree-like format. It helps users visualize the directory
structure of the file system in a clear manner, including files and

sub-directories.

1) Click 3s in the upper-left corner, select System Tools and

Terminator in sequence.

4. pip Package Installation

Python-pip is a package for Python3’s package management tool “pip”. pip is
the official package management tool for Python, used to install, upgrade and

manage Python package .

Enter the command “sudo apt-get install python3-pip” to install pip.

ubuntu@raspberrypi:~$ sudo apt-get install python3-pipff

5. transforms3d Library Installation

Transforms3d is a Python library used for 3D transformations and rotation
matrices. It provides a set of functions and classes for performing various
transformation operations in three-dimensional space, such as rotation,
translation and scaling. The traforms3d library has a simple and user-friendly
interface that can be used for handling 3D graphics, robot kinematics,
computer vision, and other fields. It supports various common presentation of

rotations, such as Euler angles, quaternions, and rotation matrices, and

provides conversion functions for converting between these representations.

Enter the command “sudo pip3 install transforms3d” to install Python library.

ubuntu@raspberrypi:~$ sudo pip3 install transforms3d

Note: Prior to the installation of transforms3d library, you need to first install pip

package.

6. turtle-tf2-py& tf2-tools Libraries Installation

turtle-tf2-py and tf2-tools are two packages in ROS, used to perform
coordinate transformation-related functionalities in Python using TF2

(Transform Library).

turtle-tf2-py provides a lightweight TF2 client library for Python, enabling
easy coordinate transformation operations in ROS. By using
ros-humble-turtle-tf2-py, you can listen for coordinate transformations, query

coordinate transformation, perform coordinate transformations, and more.

tf2-tools provides some TF-related practical tools. It includes commonly
used functionalities such as interpolation of coordinate transformations,
publishing and listening to coordinate transformations, and visualization of

coordinate frames.

Enter “sudo apt install ros-humble-turtle-tf2-py ros-humble-tf2-tools
to install turtle-tf2-py and tf2-tools libraries (humble is a version number for

ROS2.)

ubuntu@raspberrypi:~$ sudo apt install ros-humble-turtle-tf2-py ros-humb

7. Gazebo Installation

Gazebo is a powerful open-source 3D robot simulation software that helps us
quickly create and test various real-world scenarios on a computer. It comes
with a built-in precise physics engine to simulate the interactions of dynamic
objects in the scene, such as gravitational forces and friction. It also provides
excellent 3D visualization effects, allowing us to clearly see the simulation
process through a visual client. Most importantly, Gazebo integrates
seamlessly with ROS, allowing us to develop and test ROS nodes directly

within it. This enables us to easily transfer simulation code to physical robots.

Enter “sudo apt-get install ros-humble-ros-gz’ to install Gazebo

(humble is a ROS number for ROS2.)

ubuntu@raspberrypi:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-humble-ros-gzff
