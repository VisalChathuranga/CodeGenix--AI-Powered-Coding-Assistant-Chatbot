Lesson 5 ROS2 Workspace

1. Introduction to Workspace

In ROS robot development, when we develop specific functionalities for robots,

various code, parameters, scripts, and other files need to be placed in a folder

for management. This folder is called a workspace in the ROS system.

Therefore, a workspace is a folder where project-related files are stored,

serving as the main location for storing all data during the development

process.

2. Create & Compile Workspace

1) Click! 6) in the upper left corner, then select System Tools and

Terminator in sequence.

2) Enter “docker ps” to list the currently running containers

3) Enter “docker exec -it -u ubuntu -w /home/ubuntu 55ce /bin/bash”
(the container ID can be abbreviated as long as it uniquely identifies the

container) to enter the contain with ROS2 installed.

To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>"
See "man sudo_root" for details.

4) Enter “mkdir -p ~/hiwonder_ws/src’” to create a workspace called

“mkdir -p ~/hiwonder_ws/src’.

5) Enter “cd hiwonder_ws’ to switch to the workspace named

“hiwonder_ws’.

ubuntu@raspberrypi:~% cd hiwonder_ws

UBT UGT aapperyye+ :~/hiwonder_ws$

6) Enter “colcon build” to compile the workspace.

7) Enter “source ~/hiwonder_ws/install/setup.bash” to load the

workspace environment in ROS2.

ubuntu@raspberrypi:~$/ source ~/hiwonder_ws/instalL/setup. bash

ubuntu@raspberrypi:~$

8) Every time yon open a nrew terminal, step 7) will be executed to load
the workspace. However, you can enter the command “echo “source
~/hiwonder_ws/install/setup.bash” >> ~/.bashrc” to append the specified

command to the .bashrc file.

ubuntu@raspberrypi:~$ echo "source ~/hiwonder_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

ubuntu@raspberrypi:~$

9) Then enter “source ~/.bashrc’” to make the .bashrc file take effect,
thereby there is no need to load the workspace environment for each

operation.

ubuntu@raspberrypi:~$ source ~/.bashrc

ubuntu@raspberrypi:~$ Jj

3. Introduction to Workspace

After compilation, enter the command “tree -L 1” to view the root directory of

the workspace.

ubuntu@raspberrypi:~/hiwonder_ws$# tree -L 1

A typical workspace structure in ROS system is shown as above. The
“hiwonder_ws’” is the root directory of the workspace, which contains four

sub-directories, or sub-spaces.

Compilation Save intermediate files generated during the
build
workspace compilation process.
Installation
install Store the compiled executable files and scripts.
workspace
Save various logs including warnings, errors,
log Log workspace | and information during the compilation and
execution processes
Code The subsequent code and scripts need to be
src
workspace manually placed here.

All in all,most of operations are performed within the “src” folder among
these four spaces. After successful compilation, the results will be executed

from the “install” folder. The “build” and “folder” are rarely used.

Moreover, the name of the workspace can be customized, and there can

be multiple workspaces. For example:

Workspace 1: hiwonder_ws_a, used for development of robot A.
Workspace2: hiwonder_ws_b, used for development of robot B.

Workspace3: hiwonder_ws_c, used for development of robot C.

The above situations are all permitted, similar to create multiple new

projects in an integrated development environment, they all exists in parallel.
